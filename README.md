# Volume and SA of 3D Shapes
+The purpose of our program is to calculate the Surface Area and Volume of three chosen 3D Shapes; that is, a cube, rectangular prism, and a square-based prism. These shapes were chosen on the basis of having square faces. That way we can use OOP (Object Orinted Programming) inheritance properties by asking the user to input length and the height to be used in the calculations. Validity for the length and height being greater than 0 (not negative numbers) were taken into account, as well as numbers entered instead of string inputs (characters/words).
