# Volume and SA of 3D Shapes
The purpose of our program is to calculate the Surface Area and Volume of three chosen 3D Shapes; that is, a cube, rectangular prism, and a square-based pyramid. These shapes were chosen on the basis of having square faces. That way we can use OOP (Object Oriented Programming) inheritance properties to distribute the user inputted length to the three subclasses (our 3D shapes) and ask for height sepearetly in each class. A validity check for the length and height being greater than 0 (not negative numbers) as well as numbers entered instead of string (characters/words) was incorporated.
